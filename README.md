# 'Size-Up!' #

Size Up!

In this 2D platformer built with the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) (v3.1) engine, you must traverse the castle in this puzzle-platformer that makes use of your size!

## Installation ##

You'll need to have at least v3.1 of the [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) engine installed if you want to run this project.

1. Clone the repository to your local development environment.
2. Open the project with Godot using the 'project.godot' file or by selecting the 'src' folder from the engine's 'Open Project' menu option.

## Binaries ##

At this time, there are no binaries of the game that you can try out. This section will be expanded once that changes.

If you want to build the project for yourself follow the official engine documentation for the [Export](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/getting_started/workflow/export/index.html) workflow.
